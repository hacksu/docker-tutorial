Containerization is the process of turning an application or piece of software into a containerized form. This containerized form becomes an independent application that runs by itself without help from any outside sources. So, now it becomes important to discuss what a container actually is, and how they work. Why is containerization an important skill to understand and learn more about?

Well, a container, as mentioned before, is an independent environment that holds a piece of software or an application. A container contains 3 components to achieve independence.

    Every container contains a small isolated operating system, whether it be Linux-based or Windows-based.
    Each container includes all the dependencies, environmental variables, and scripts needed for a specific application.
    Finally, the container includes the code and configurations to run the application.

Containers are essentially tools that work out of the box, meaning they function as soon as you run the container, and usually do not need any extra setup if built correctly. This offers a lot of unique benefits, for example: if you want to develop a project with a friend, instead of needing to make sure your friend has all the required tools needed to run the application, you can just make a container and share it with your friend. This way, you can continue to develop the application without needing to install any additional tools on your friend's computer.

The biggest drawback to a containerized lifestyle is the computational power (specifically the amount of RAM) required. Since containers are small independent systems, they take up more RAM than a typical application would if it was not containerized. The amount of RAM used by containers is dependent on each situation, but from what I have seen, it is usually around 1-3 GB of RAM per container. For example, if you are just needing to run an SQL server on your machine, this container will take up around 1 GB of RAM.

Now, letâ€™s get more in-depth with how to create and run containers on your own system.

Now, for a few important terms:

    Images: Images are blueprints for containers. With an image, you can make multiple of the same exact container.
    Volumes: Volumes are a way to store data in a container without actually taking up space in a container. It acts as a pointer to a storage system on the host machine that is running the container.
        Volumes are one of the only ways that a container can have direct access to the host machine.
    Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is the main processor involved with running containers. The Docker engine acts as a "Client-side application" with a server for a daemon process called dockerd.
    Dockerd: Dockerd is a persistent process provided by the Docker engine for running containers. This is mainly a background tool that runs without you needing to know about it.

The mainstream tool that most developers will use is an application called Docker. Docker is a tool used to run, create, and manage containers. Docker comes in a few different formats:

    If you are on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you can download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
    If you are on Linux, you can also install the Docker Engine for interacting with Docker via the command line.

The most user-friendly version of Docker is their GUI application called Docker Desktop. From this application, you can pull images from Docker Hub (which is a repository system for storing images).

    By the way, images are blueprints of containers. You need an image to run a container.

# We will be using the Docker CLI provided by installing Docker Desktop onto your system for the rest of the tutorial

Docker CLI is a command line interface for interacting with Docker. We will be using Docker CLI for the majority of this lesson.

Once you all have Docker Desktop installed onto your system, make sure to have Docker Desktop currently running as the only way to run containers is by having the "Docker Engine" running. So now that everyone has Docker running on their computers, it is time to begin a demonstration of a few different Docker tools.

Firstly: the main way to create a container is by using a thing called a Dockerfile:

Now, as the instructor, go to the "helloWorldDocker" folder and do a build along with the Dockerfile. It is super basic stuff. First, have everyone at the lesson make a new folder and open an IDE (like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text). Second, make an index.html file in that new folder: Put in a basic hello world script
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
Then tell them to make a file called "Dockerfile": The D must be capital.

Remind them that the Dockerfile is how an Image is created.

Once the Dockerfile is created, add in this code:
```
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
```
The FROM statement in the Dockerfile is calling an image called "nginx
" as the base of the Docker image. All Docker images are built off of other Docker images, so the first line in the Dockerfile should always be a FROM statement.

The COPY statement takes the index.html file we created and copies it into the container at the directory of "/usr/share/nginx/html/"

The EXPOSE statement exposes the port number 80, so when you run the container you can connect to the container from port number 80.

Then, once the Dockerfile and index.html file has been created, tell everyone to open up a command prompt. Then have everyone use the "cd" command to go to the directory for the helloWorld application. Make sure everyone is in the right folder.

Now in order to start the container, we have to build it first. The building sequence takes the Dockerfile and generates us an image that can be used as the blueprint for our container.

So type out the following command:
```
docker build -t hello-world:0.1 .
```
The -t tag represents the name of the container followed by the tag of the container, so it will be called helloWorld with a tag number or version number of 0.1. Then the . represents the location of the Dockerfile, which is the current directory.

The Docker build command will create for us a Docker image, so once the build command finishes we can type out:
```
docker run -p 80:80 -t hello-world:0.1
```
The -p tag represents the port number the application is accessible on, and the -t tag represents the Docker image being run.

Now that the container is running, open up the web browser and go to localhost:80 and the Hello World application should be up and running perfectly!

# Minecraft Docker Container Tutorial

After setting up the nginx mini container setup, this next part will explore Docker-Compose files, and how they work by using Docker-Compose to set up and run your own Minecraft server!

Firstly, Docker-Compose is a configuration file used for managing containers in an easy way. When working with containers, you sometimes have to write a long command in the command line in order to start the container. For example:
```
docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE itzg/minecraft-server
```
This command is how you would be able to start a Minecraft server with just the Docker CLI. But it can become tedious to have to type this command out every time you want to change something or when you want to run the server again. That is why it is recommended to create a docker-compose.yml file to manage your container settings in one easy-to-use place.

Docker Compose is a powerful tool as well when needing to run multiple containers and having these containers talk to each other. Docker Compose has many uses to it, but with the limited amount of time, we will restrict it to the basics for the demo.

Source: https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1. Create a new directory
2. Put the contents of the code below in a file called docker-compose.yml
3. Run docker compose up -d in that directory
4. Done! Point your client at your host's name/IP address and port 25565.

Here is the full code. Also included is a step-by-step explanation of each line of code.
```
services:
  mc:
    image: itzg/minecraft-server
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - "25565:25565"
    environment:
      EULA: "TRUE"
    volumes:
      # attach the relative directory 'data' to the container's /data path
      - ./data:/data
```
Step by step:
    ```services:```
The first part of the docker-compose.yml file is a thing called "services", which are processes that need to be run by docker, so in our case it represents the containers.

Next: ```mc:``` represents the name of the name of a service. In the "services" you can have multiple service, so by giving each service a unique name it allows docker to differantiate easier.

Next: ```image: itzg/minecraft-server``` represents the image that docker will be running. "itzg" is the name of the author of the image, and "minecraft-server" is the name of the image repository. 

Next: ```tty: true``` helps to set up an interactive shell for the container, which is important for sending commands to the container.

Next: ```stdin_open: true``` is used with combination with "tty" to help interaction with the container

Next: 
```
ports:
  - "25565:25565"
```
This tells docker what port to start and point the container at, which allows for communication between the container and the user.
Next: ```enviroment:``` is needed when setting environental variables before the container starts. It can be very useful.
Next: ```EULA: "TRUE"``` sets the environmental variable "EULA" to True, which is the Minecraft user agreement lisence.
Next: ```volumes:``` is very useful for attaching extrenal storage drives to the container, and in our case ```- ./data:/data``` is the volume that needs to be attached. This creates a new directory called "data" inside the container, and it creates a symbolic link between the directory of "data" in our personal machine.

To apply changes made to the compose file, just run docker compose up -d again.

Follow the logs of the container using docker compose logs -f, check on the status with docker compose ps, and stop the container using docker compose stop.
